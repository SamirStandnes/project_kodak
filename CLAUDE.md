## Architecture Overview

**Pattern:** ELT (Extract, Load, Transform). Raw broker data is loaded into a ledger (`transactions` table), and metrics (holdings, XIRR, P&L) are calculated on-demand at runtime—never pre-computed.

### Data Flow

1. **Ingest** → User drops CSV/Excel in `data/new_raw_transactions/<broker>/`
2. **Parse** → `kodak/pipeline/ingest.py` auto-loads `kodak/pipeline/parsers/<broker>.py`
3. **Stage** → Deduplicated rows go to `transactions_staging` for user review
4. **Commit** → `kodak/pipeline/review_commit.py` moves staged data to permanent `transactions` table
5. **Enrich** → `fetch_prices.py` and `enrich_fx.py` pull market data from Yahoo Finance
6. **Report** → `kodak/shared/calculations.py` computes holdings, cost basis, XIRR

### Key Modules

- **`kodak/shared/calculations.py`** - Core math: XIRR, cost basis, holdings, split adjustments
- **`kodak/shared/db.py`** - SQLite connection management with context managers
- **`kodak/shared/parser_utils.py`** - Transaction validation, `create_empty_transaction()` template
- **`kodak/shared/market_data.py`** - Yahoo Finance integration

### Currency Handling

The system is currency-agnostic. Base currency is set in `config.yaml`:
- `amount` = value in **asset's trading currency** (e.g., USD for Apple)
- `amount_local` = value in **base currency** (e.g., NOK)
- `exchange_rate` = conversion factor (`amount_local / amount`)

Never hardcode currency strings. Always use `load_config().get('base_currency')`.

### Transaction Types

Defined in `config.yaml` under `transaction_types`. Three categories:
- `inflow`: BUY, DEPOSIT, TRANSFER_IN, plus broker-specific variants
- `outflow`: SELL, WITHDRAWAL, TRANSFER_OUT, plus broker-specific variants
- `external_flows`: Cash movements used for XIRR calculation

### Adding a New Parser

1. Create `kodak/pipeline/parsers/<broker>.py`
2. Import `create_empty_transaction` from `parser_utils` and `clean_num` from `utils`
3. Implement `def parse(file_path) -> List[Dict]`
4. Test with `python -m kodak.maintenance.test_parser <broker> path/to/sample.csv`

Parsers must set `currency` to the **asset's** currency, not the settlement currency. Back-calculate `amount` from `amount_local` if needed.

## Code Conventions

- Use `logging` module, not `print()` for debug output
- Use `with get_db_connection() as conn:` for database access
- Validate parser output with `validate_parser_output()` before returning
- Type hints on public functions in shared modules
