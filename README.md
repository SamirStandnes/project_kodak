# Kodak Portfolio Tracker 📈

A robust, multi-currency investment portfolio tracking system with a serverless-ready architecture.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Project Kodak is designed to be currency-agnostic. You can configure your global settings in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# The base currency for all reporting (e.g., NOK, USD, EUR)
base_currency: NOK
```

This setting affects:
- The default currency for new accounts.
- The target currency for all performance reports and charts.
- Automatic FX rate enrichment.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Plugin-Based Ingestion:** Add support for new brokers just by dropping a Python script into the `parsers/` folder.
*   **Multi-Currency Engine:** Automatic historical FX rate enrichment using Yahoo Finance.
*   **Deep Performance Analysis:** Tracks Realized/Unrealized Gains, Dividend yields, Interest expenses, and FX P&L.
*   **Staging Workflow:** Review and verify transactions before they hit your master database.
*   **Modern Dashboard:** Interactive UI built with Streamlit and Plotly.

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

### Adding New Transactions
1.  **Export:** Download your transaction history from your broker (e.g., Nordnet CSV or Saxo Excel).
2.  **Place:** Move the files to the matching folder in `data/new_raw_transactions/`.
3.  **Run Pipeline:** 
    ```powershell
    .\workflows\add_transactions.ps1
    ```
    *This will ingest files, ask for confirmation to commit to the DB, and then automatically fetch prices and FX rates.*

### Refreshing Prices (No new trades)
To see how your portfolio is doing today without adding new data:
```powershell
.\workflows\refresh_market_data.ps1
```

### Automate Daily Updates (Optional)
Set up a scheduled task to refresh prices automatically:

**Windows (Task Scheduler):**
1. Open Task Scheduler → Create Basic Task
2. Trigger: "When I log on" or "Daily"
3. Action: Start a program
   - Program: `powershell.exe`
   - Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\kodak-portfolio\workflows\refresh_market_data.ps1"`

**Mac/Linux (cron):**
```bash
# Make script executable (one-time)
chmod +x workflows/refresh_market_data.sh

# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add line to run daily at 8am
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/kodak-portfolio && ./workflows/refresh_market_data.sh
```

### Launching the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run kodak/dashboard/Home.py
```

## 📊 Terminal Analysis Tools

Prefer the command line? Use these scripts for quick insights:
- **Portfolio Summary:** `python -m kodak.cli.analyze_portfolio` (Current Value & Unrealized Gains)
- **Yearly Performance:** `python -m kodak.cli.analyze_performance_realized` (Realized Gains, Dividends, & Cash Flow)
- **FX Analysis:** `python -m kodak.cli.analyze_fx` (Currency P&L)
- **Dividends/Fees/Interest:** Check `kodak/cli/` for more specialized tools.

## 🧩 Adding a New Broker (Plugin System)

Project Kodak is designed to be infinitely extensible. To add a new broker (e.g., "Robinhood"):

1.  **Create Folder:** `data/new_raw_transactions/robinhood/`
2.  **Inspect Sample:** Run our helper to see the file structure:
    ```bash
    python -m kodak.maintenance.inspect_file path/to/sample.csv
    ```
3.  **Create Parser:** Create `kodak/pipeline/parsers/robinhood.py`.
4.  **Implement:** Define a `parse(file_path)` function that returns the standard transaction schema.

*(Tip: You can paste the output of the inspection tool into an AI like ChatGPT/Claude to have it write the parser for you in seconds!)*
