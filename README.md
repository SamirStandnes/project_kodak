# Project Kodak

## A. Primary Goals (Revised and Reordered)
- **Unify Data & Performance:** Create a centralized, standardized database (portfolio.db) capable of consolidating all transaction data from disparate brokerage sources and calculating Unified Performance Metrics (e.g., Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Time-Weighted Return (TWR)) across all brokerage accounts.

- **Quantify Valuation Gap:** Develop a reliable method to calculate and track the percentage difference between the portfolio's aggregate Intrinsic Value and its Market Value daily.

- **Establish Modeling Capability:** Implement and operationalize at least one core intrinsic valuation model.

- **Enable Seamless Data Entry:** Provide a simple, structured method (terminal interface) for ongoing manual input of new trades after the initial historical data load.
